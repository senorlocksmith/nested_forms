# README

This is a simple Rails 6 basic app with Webpacker. Running on Ruby 2.7.1. 

My attempts here are to create nested forms and models using has_many :through and belongs_to attributes. 

I have followed tutorials on how to do some of these but trying to workout the join tables and shallow routes so its following best practices. 

Please note this is not a fully working or functional example. This is posted so anyone willing to help can see what I have done. I will be updating as we go and later sharing this example with others who are confused with this type of process.
